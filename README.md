## What is this?
This is something I jotted during AWS corporate event to cover event processors leveraging various AWS services.

Contains too much cheap hacks but could be useful for someone doing similar thing.

## How does this work?
It expects two HTTP requests per unique ID and respond combined payload back to HTTP endpoint.
